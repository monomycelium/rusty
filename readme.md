Greetings! This is my repository for learning and exploring Rust. Feel free to explore. Join us Rustaceans in remaking the world!

## projects
- [`lewis`](/lewis): trying out `tui-rs` by writing a bucket list app for a friend as a birthday gift.
- [`nextbus`](/nextbus): a command-line tool using `lta-rs` to fetch bus timings using the LTA API.

## note
If you'd like to work with me on a Rust (or C) project, please reach out!
